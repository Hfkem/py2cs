Chapter 2: Basic Electronics

In Arduino, the fundamental electronics is the core of building any electronic project. This chapter introduces the mechanism used by Arduino to control electronic components and basic electronics knowledge.

First, let's take a look at a simple electronic circuit! We can use the following program to make the LED blink:

```C++
int ledPin = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

The purpose of this program is to teach you how to control an LED light. It will light up for one second, turn off for one second, and then start again. However, there are not many details about electronics here. So, next we will introduce the basics of circuit components, circuit principles, Arduino circuit diagrams, and so on.

## Circuit Components

In the Arduino circuit, there are many types and models of electronic components. Here are some basic electronic components.

### 1. Resistor

A resistor is a device used to limit the flow of electric current. The resistance value of the resistor is expressed in ohms. The most commonly used resistor in Arduino and other electronic projects is the 220-ohm resistor, which is used to protect the LED light.

Here is a circuit of an LED light using a 220 ohm resistor:

### 2. Capacitor

A capacitor is a device used to store electric charge. The capacitance of the capacitor is measured in farads. It is responsible for storing and releasing charges in Arduino. You may see traces of capacitors in some interfaces and circuits.

### 3. Transistor

A transistor is a semiconductor device that can be used to amplify or control current. There are many types of transistors, but the most commonly used ones in Arduino are PNP and NPN transistors.

### 4. FET

A field-effect transistor (FET) is a very common electronic component that can be used to control current. It is typically used for amplifying current, converting voltage, and inverting signal polarity.

## Basic Circuit Principles

When designing circuits in Arduino, it is important to be familiar with basic electronics theory, such as Ohm's Law. If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, it is recommended that you read textbooks on basic electronics.

For example, if we change the LED circuit diagram above to connect the LED light through a 220-ohm resistor to a 5V power source, what does this mean?

To answer this question, we need to use Ohm's Law: `V = I * R`. Here, V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

In this example, the LED uses a current of 20 milliamperes and a 220-ohm resistor is used. Therefore, applying V = I * R, we get:

V = (20/1000) * 220 = 4.4V

Thus, in this example, the LED light will light up with a voltage of 4.4V.

## Arduino Circuit Diagram

Finally, here is the Arduino circuit diagram, which includes what needs to be done and how to use basic electronics to design circuits.

In this diagram, you can see the following components:

- ATmega328P: This is the microcontroller used by Arduino UNO.
- Capacitor: It is used to stabilize power supplied by USB.
- Chrystal: Provides clock signal for ATmega328P.
- Voltage regulator: Regulates power supply voltage.
- LED: The LED led out by Arduino UNO.
- Button: The circuit can be turned on and off using the button.
- Digital and analog pins: Input and output pins of Arduino UNO.

That's the basics of electronics in this chapter. We hope this section has helped you!
